    <!--  Episode Slug
          Use all lowercase letters with dashes and underscores and do not use spaces for the episode-slug
          This episode-slug MUST match the exact directory name where this file lives
          For consistency (but not required) follow this format:
            1.) Using a dash, start the episode-slug with the episode number, IE: "episode-#"
            2.) Use an underscore after the episode number and persona name
            3.) Using dashes again, end the episode-slug with the personas name, IE: "first-last"
          EXAMPLE: "episode-01_derek-mauk" -->

    <sergey-template name="episode-name">Episode 4</sergey-template>
  
  
    <!--  Persona Name

    <sergey-template name="persona-name">Tobias van Schneider</sergey-template>

    <!--  Persona Hero Image URL
            The persona-hero-image-url property is the hero image itself – Preferably a jpg image stored locally
            This property renders as an inline style from the episode template
          EXAMPLE: "background-image: url(/assets/img/hero_tobias-van-schneider.jpg);" -->
    <sergey-template name="persona-hero-image-url">background-image: url(/assets/img/hero_tobias-van-schneider.jpg);</sergey-template>
  
  
    <!--  Hero Image Credit
      *** NOT A REQUIRED PROPERTY ***
          If persona-hero-image-url usage/license credit is not required or available, then:
            Remove all space between the open and close tag for this property
            EXAMPLE: <></>
          If persona-hero-image-url usage/license credit is available or required, then:
            Enter all content desired to show in this space

          *** NOT A REQUIRED PROPERTY ***
            Removing everything between the opening and closing sergey tags (spaces included) will not not havce a negative effect, it simply wont render any watermark words

          <b>Randy:</b> We would like to welcome Tobias van Schneider to The Innovation Series. You describe yourself as a multidisciplinary maker of useful, curious and beautiful things. So tell us a little about what useful, curious and beautiful things are you making currently?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>Tobias:</b> Right now I’m focusing on <a href="https://www.semplice.com/" target="_blank">Semplice</a>, my portfolio system for designers. We just launched Semplice 4 after working on the new features for over a year, and I’m excited to see what designers do with it. I’m also writing a lot about design and productivity on my blog, <a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/blog" target="_blank">DESK</a>. Then there are a couple side projects like my <a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/introducing-unsplash-x-van-schneider" target="_blank">sweatshirt collaboration with Unsplash</a> and some fun interface work I can’t share just yet. I’m always working on too many things at once and I like it that way.

        <p class="question">
          <b>Randy:</b> I know through following you for the past few years that you are a big believer in keeping busy. In
          <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/more-work-worse-outcome-52837a524221" target="_blank">More Work, Worse Outcome</a>, Jason Fried has said that doing the right thing at the right time is the difference maker. Not brute force. Do you agree and how do you balance your time across multiple projects in order to do your best work?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>Tobias:</b> I agree with Jason that timing can mean everything, and we can certainly improve our productivity or efficiency by putting in the right amount of effort at the right time. But I also believe hard work pays off. In Jason’s example, he regrets shoveling the snow on his sidewalks all day when he could have waited until the evening and shoveled once. But the whole point of shoveling is to keep the sidewalks clean for pedestrians, right? If he’s leaving the snow to pile up until the end of the day, why shovel at all? <br /><br />I do my best work when I consistently put in the effort and the time. Of course I strive for efficiency and welcome any shortcut I can find – but at the end of the day, nothing happens unless we work for it.
