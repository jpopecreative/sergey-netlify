                <b>Randy:</b> We would like to welcome Tobias van Schneider to
                The Innovation Series. You describe yourself as a
                multidisciplinary maker of useful, curious and beautiful things.
                So tell us a little about what useful, curious and beautiful
                things are you making currently?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">

                >, my portfolio system for designers. We just launched Semplice
                4 after working on the new features for over a year, and I’m
                excited to see what designers do with it. I’m also writing a lot
                about design and productivity on my blog,

                and some fun interface work I can’t share just yet. I’m always
                working on too many things at once and I like it that way.

                  >More Work, Worse Outcome</a
                >, Jason Fried has said that doing the right thing at the right
                time is the difference maker. Not brute force. Do you agree and
                how do you balance your time across multiple projects in order
                to do your best work?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                <b>Tobias:</b> I agree with Jason that timing can mean
                everything, and we can certainly improve our productivity or
                efficiency by putting in the right amount of effort at the right
                time. But I also believe hard work pays off. In Jason’s example,
                he regrets shoveling the snow on his sidewalks all day when he
                could have waited until the evening and shoveled once. But the
                whole point of shoveling is to keep the sidewalks clean for
                pedestrians, right? If he’s leaving the snow to pile up until
                the end of the day, why shovel at all? <br /><br />I do my best
                work when I consistently put in the effort and the time. Of
                course I strive for efficiency and welcome any shortcut I can
                find – but at the end of the day, nothing happens unless we work
                for it.
